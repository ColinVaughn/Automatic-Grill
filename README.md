# Automatic-Grill
Automate a gas grill!


This program will automate a gas grill then you can connect to it on your phone via wifi to automate your grilling!


The program was wrote for my fathers need so it doesn't connect to a wifi and instead host it's own, this is because my dad takes his grill to places without internet and this was the easiest option for him.


Safety Features
Automatic shutoff for power loss, and overpressuring
Regulator throttling based on pressure (if over a certain value it will shut everything down, if under a certain value it will attempt to lower it by itself.)

Limitations
This setup should technically use two pressure sensors one before and after the valve to ensure one isn't reading incorrectly but atm it's not that big of a deal.


Requirements
Screen (I'm using a 20x4)
Whatever the name of the thing that rotates and can be clicked in to give a value
Pressure Sensor (Minimal 1 recommended 2)
Stepper Motor
Electric valve that defaults in the off position
Wifi board.
